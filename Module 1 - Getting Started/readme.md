# Get Started with Azure AI Services

In this exercise, you'll get started with Azure AI Services by creating an **Azure AI Services** resource in your Azure subscription and using it from a client application. The goal of the exercise is not to gain expertise in any particular service, but rather to become familiar with a general pattern for provisioning and working with Azure AI services as a developer.

## Clone the repository in Visual Studio Code

You'll develop your code using Visual Studio Code. The code files for your app have been provided in a GitHub repo.

1. Start Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and run a **Git: Clone** command to clone the `///` repository to a local folder (it doesn't matter which folder).
3. Open the folder in VS Code
4. Ensure you have all the dependencies
5. Expand the `Module 1 - Getting Started>` folder.

## Provision an Azure AI Services resource

Azure AI Services are cloud-based services that encapsulate artificial intelligence capabilities you can incorporate into your applications. You can provision individual Azure AI services resources for specific APIs (for example, **Language** or **Vision**), or you can provision a single **Azure AI Services** resource that provides access to multiple Azure AI services APIs through a single endpoint and key. In this case, you'll use a single **Azure AI Services** resource.

1. Open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. In the top search bar, search for *Azure AI services*, select **Azure AI Services**, and create an Azure AI services multi-service account resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Choose or create a resource group (if you are using a restricted subscription, you may not have permission to create a new resource group - use the one provided)*
    - **Region**: *Choose any available region*
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0


3. Select the required checkboxes and create the resource.
4. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.
5. Go to the resource and view its **Keys and Endpoint** page and look for **content understanding**. This page contains the information that you will need to connect to your resource and use it from applications you develop. Specifically:
    - An HTTP *endpoint* to which client applications can send requests.
    - Two *keys* that can be used for authentication (client applications can use either key to authenticate).
    - The *location* where the resource is hosted. This is required for requests to some (but not all) APIs.

## Use a REST Interface

The Azure AI services APIs are REST-based, so you can consume them by submitting JSON requests over HTTP. In this example, you'll explore a console application that uses the **Language** REST API to perform language detection; but the basic principle is the same for all of the APIs supported by the Azure AI Services resource.


2. View the contents of the **rest-client** folder, and note that it contains a file for configuration settings:

    - **Python**: .env

    Open the configuration file and update the configuration values it contains to reflect the **endpoint** and an authentication **key** for your Azure AI services resource. Save your changes.

3. Note that the **pyhton-rest-call** folder contains a code file for the client application:

       - **Python**: rest-client.py

    Open the code file and review the code it contains, noting the following details:
    - Various namespaces are imported to enable HTTP communication
    - Code in the **Main** function retrieves the endpoint and key for your Azure AI services resource - these will be used to send REST requests to the Text Analytics service.
    - The program accepts user input, and uses the **GetLanguage** function to call the Text Analytics language detection REST API for your Azure AI services endpoint to detect the language of the text that was entered.
    - The request sent to the API consists of a JSON object containing the input data - in this case, a collection of **document** objects, each of which has an **id** and **text**.
    - The key for your service is included in the request header to authenticate your client application.
    - The response from the service is a JSON object, which the client application can parse.

4. Make sure you have python installed. If not install it or type python from the terminal and Windows should prompt you. Then follow the commands below to install python-dotenv


    **Python**

    pip install python-dotenv
    python rest-client.py
    ```

5. When prompted, enter some text and review the language that is detected by the service, which is returned in the JSON response. For example, try entering "Hello", "Bonjour", and "Gracias" to see if it detects the various languages.
6. When you have finished testing the application, enter "quit" to stop the program.
